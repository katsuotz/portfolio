            A few months ago beore ESL One Kuala Lumpur 2023, my friend and I
            went to the Bali Major to watch a Dota 2 tournament. The Bali Major
            event was decent, but the vibe felt quite chill because the venue
            wasnâ€™t very big. When ESL announced a new event called ESL One Kuala
            Lumpur 2023, with a much larger and more affordable venue than the
            Bali Major, we thought, why not give it a try?

            </h4>
            <p>
              I stayed near the venue at an Airbnb called Arte Mont Kiara. Itâ€™s
              about a 10-minute walk to the ESL One KL venue at the Malaysia
              International Trade and Exhibition Centre (MITEC).
            </p>
            <p>
              Itâ€™s an apartment-style accommodation. The total price was{' '}
              <b>IDR 3,900,000</b> for 7 nights. Since we stayed together (3
              people), it only cost <b>IDR 186,000 per night</b> each.

              Venue
            </h4>
            <p>
              This was my first time attending an e-sports event with such a big
              stage. There were so many things to see live. From my seat, I
              could clearly see the players, hosts, panelists, and casters,
              which made the experience much more immersive.
            </p>
            <p>
              For reference, when I attended the Bali Major, the panelists and
              casters werenâ€™t even at the venue. They cast the event from a
              hotel, which felt very odd.

            <p>
              The booths offered various activities like airbrush tattoos, Intel

              Reading, and more.

              The food options were plentiful, including Nasi Goreng, Malaysian
              dishes, and Mexican food like tacos. The prices were reasonable
              for such an event, starting at around <b>RM 10 (IDR 34,000)</b>.
              Free Monster Energy drinks were also available.

              ESL One merchandise included team jerseys, ESL apparel, hero

              items were sold out. I managed to buy the last Team Secret jersey
              in XS and some plushies. Jerseys were priced at{' '}

              affordable at RM 20â€“40 (IDR 69,000â€“138,000) with a buy-1-get-1
              deal. Hero T-shirts were also on sale with the same deal for only{' '}
